This program brings you convinience in selecting how much you need to sleep and what time you need to getup in order to maintain a healthy and effective sleep.
A healthy sleep cycle consists of 5 stages: 
	1) N1 (light sleep) 
	2) N2 (deeper sleep) 
	3) N3 (deepest sleep) 
	4) REM (rapid eye movement) sleep 
	5) N1 again. 
This cycle typically repeats 4-5 times per night, with longer periods of N3 and REM occurring later in the night. A healthy sleep cycle is important for physical and mental restoration, learning and memory consolidation, and emotional regulation. The recommended amount of sleep is 7-9 hours per night for adults
